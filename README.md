## Introduction

This is the repository for Align Racing's 2019 formula student race car.


## Align Racing UiA

<a href="http://www.alignracing.no/">Align Racing UiA (AR)</a> is a multidisciplinary student organisation at <a href="https://www.uia.no/">The University of Agder (UiA)</a>, that take part in the world’s largest yearly engineering competition; <a href="https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student">Formula Student (FS)</a>. The organisation continuously consists of around 60 students, from a wide variety of disciplines. The competition includes developing, building, budgeting and marketing a small scale formula type racing car. AR takes this a bit further by having more focus on developing a strong organisation, open for all disciplines, that gives the members a taste of future work-life.
